## Platforms

SpotHack aims to run on several platforms such as Web, Mobile and Desktop. At this moment this is what we have available:

### Android (React Native)

The first variant of SpotHack was written in ReactNative to download your Spotify playlists directly to your phone.

## Disclaimer

This project can be considered a piracy service to download music. No source code here was used in production, nor was it ever used with the idea of making money. I only disposed of the code as open source because this is a study project. If you want to use it as a service, use it at your own risk, but remember that artists and publishers are likely to own the downloaded music.
